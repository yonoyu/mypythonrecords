Add new movies to own collection
so that i can keep track of all my movies

List all the movies in my collection 
so that i can see what movies I already have

Find a movie by using the movie title
so that i can locate a specific movie easily when the
collection grows


Implementation Tasks:

1. Decide where to store movies in code
Whether we are gonna be using a database, 
whether we're gonna be pulling things in a dictionary or a List or variables

Essentially: Where is the data that our program relies on gonna go?

2. Decide what data we want to store for each movie
Whether that's gonna be a dictionary representing some movie properties
or a tuple with just the properties themselves etc etc
dictionary: movie title, director and release year

3. Show the user a menu and let them pick an option.

4. Implement each requirement in turn: add, list and find movies,
each as a separate function

5. Stop running the program when they type in 'q' in the menu
